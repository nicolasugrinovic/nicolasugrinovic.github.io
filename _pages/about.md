I am Nicolas Ugrinovic a Ph.D. student jointly at [Barcelona Tech University](https://www.upc.edu/en) and [IRI](https://www.iri.upc.edu/) 
under the supervision of [Francesc Moreno-Noguer](http://www.iri.upc.edu/people/fmoreno/) and 
[Alberto Sanfeliu](http://www.iri.upc.edu/people/sanfeliu/). I am currently visiting Naver Labs Europe with 
[Gregory Rogez](https://europe.naverlabs.com/people_user/Gregory-Rogez/) and 
[Philippe Weinzaepfel](https://europe.naverlabs.com/people_user/pweinzae/) in the wonderful city of Grenoble, France. 

My research interests lie in the intersection of computer vision, deep learning, and 3D humans. Specifically, human motion generation, 
human pose estimation, and reconstruction.
